Function of Banks

Causes of Banking Failures
--------------------------
Now we know a bit more about the functions of a bank and how it works, it is easier to explain what the causes of a banking failure are. Of course there is not a single cause of a failure, often a combination of different factors play a role in explaining why a banking failure happened.

As seen in the previous sector, banks receive surplus money from people who do not need it at the moment (deposits) and loan this money to people who do need it (loans). This function of the bank is also where problems tend to exist. The maturity of a bank's liabilities are often shorter than the maturity of its assets. Deposits are often short term and can be withdrawn by customers at any moment. Loans on the other hand are long term, think about mortgages for example. All kinds of mismatching problems then start to develop. If either the assets drop in value or deposits are withdrawn at a massive rate, the bank will fail.
What causes assets to drop in value and deposits to be withdrawn? We will start with the first. To illustrate this we use the 2008 financial crisis as an example. Before the crisis interest rates were relatively low while home prices were increasing. Many people therefore took out a mortgage. This seemed to be a good investment. Even people who were not really able to afford those mortgages were able to get one. As long as home prices increase, there is not really a problem. Then you make a profit and you are sure to finance your mortgage. However if home prices do not longer increase that is when problems start to arise. Interest rates also started to increase and therefore the monthly payments increased. Especially people who could not afford the mortgage in the first place, but who were not checked by the bank, could not afford the monthly payments. The borrowers therefore partly or even completely default on their loans. The bank's assets are therefore decreased in value and unless the bank has enough cash reserves, the bank is not able to pay off its depositors.

A drop in the value of a bank's assets is not the only way a bank can become insolvent. As stated earlier, a withdrawal of liabilities i.e. deposits, can also cause a bank to become insolvent. If many depositors withdraw their money at the same time, this can also be called a bank run. Depositors do this because they believe that the bank is not able to repay their depositors. We showed this in the mortgage example. Deposits as stated before are liquid and can be withdrawn at any moment by the customer. The bank's assets are on the other hand illiquid and long term. A bank usually has some cash reserves but these reserves are dried up quite quickly. If then a lot of deposits are withdrawn at the same time, the bank has a problem. The bank has to sell these illiquid assets, for example mortgages. This is however not possible or it has to sell them at only a fraction of their true value. Again the bank's assets are then decreased in value and this will drain the capital reserves of the bank. The end result is that the bank will become insolvent.
We have covered two situations which can make a bank fail. One in which the assets drop in value and one in which deposits are withdrawn. There are however many more causes for a banking failure. Bad management and excessive risk-taking to name a few. It is important to understand that a banking failure generally arises from a set of different causes. A lot can be done to prevent banking failures, in our examples, if the bank had more cash reserves the problem would not have been as bad. This will however be discussed later.

Consequences of Banking Failures
---------------------------------
Banks and financial institutions are important institutions that allocate capital, both from persons who have a supply of capital – usually households or firms -  to firms or households in need of capital. Banks and other financial institutions are also needed in this process, because they have the ability to transform short-term credit to long-term debt for, for instance, mortgages and commercial bonds. 
If banks fail, however, this process is distorted. The most important consequences are presented here: 

**Bank runs**

Banks are unable to fulfil their debt obligations towards firms or households with deposits at the bank. This could, in turn, lead to a bank run, when people with deposits at the bank try to redeem their money, fearing that their deposits will be used to pay off other debitors of the bank. While this behaviour is very understandable, it only worsens the problems of the bank and to prevent this from happening, the government usually intervenes and guarantees they payback of your deposits. If a bank is unable to do so, the government ill do this themselves. Such schemes have been installed in all countries of the EU. The government guarantees only deposits to a certain amount (100 000 in the Netherlands). 
But, even now deposits of non-commercial parties are protected, the government is responsible for paying these guarantees and also bears the costs of it. 

**Credit rollovers**

Firms usually have long-term debt, but occasionally also use short-term debt to finance their capital needs. If banks fail and are no longer able to provide debt to their customers, these firms can come in problems as well. The failing of a bank can for a firm mean that they have to find other forms of credit with more costs attached. 

**Systematic risk**

Banks usually are interdependent and borrow from and lend to other banks and financial institutions. If one bank fails, other banks can also get into trouble to meet their obligations when one or more of their debtors default. 

The entire financial system can also be threatened if the failing bank is so large that other financial institutions are not able to replace the role of the failing bank instantly. 

**Credit provision**

If banks fail and the entire financial system is distorted as a result of this, or no other bank is able to fulfil the functions of the failing bank, then the real economy can suffer from the failing bank, as ne companies or households can no longer find credit to finance their projects or fulfil their desires. New, innovative companies can no longer find credit to use their ideas to make the economy more efficient and households cannot find money to finance houses, even though they could have the money to pay off their debts later. Economists call this situation sub-optimal, as these actors are not able to do something they would like to do. 

History of Banking Failures
-----------------------------
Ever since banks were created the possibility that they could fail has been present. The causes for failure 
in the first banks were due to mismanagement or external factors that banks did not foresee and were 
not prepared to face. One of the first documented cases of a banking failure in Europe is the Amsterdam 
banking crisis of 1763. This crisis came about because the banking sector in the Netherlands had borrowed 
heavily using basic goods as collateral (a guarantee of payment), these goods were sold at a higher price 
than usual due to the Seven Year’s War. When the war was over the prices of the basic goods fell 
dramatically and the amount of money available decreased to a point where intervention by the Bank of 
Amsterdam was required to provide enough money for the banking system. Throughout the rest of the 
18th and 19th centuries most of the banking failures were triggered by mismanagement in banks and/or 
critical loss of confidence from the depositors in the ability of the banks to repay the money that had been 
deposited in their institutions. Notable examples of these situations are the Panics of 1825 and 1866. In 
the year of 1825 a stock market crash in London that was caused from reckless investments in Latin 
America caused the collapse of six banks in London, this event is considered to mark the beginning of the 
modern economic cycles due to the fact that the panic was not caused by an external event but rather by 
speculative behavior. In the 1866 crisis, the failure of a bank called Overend, Gurney and Co. again because 
of mismanagement, prompted the failure of over 200 companies. In the 20th century the worst banking 
crisis was the Great Depression in United States. This event in 1929 was caused by a crash in the American 
Stock Market. Four years later 11,000 of United States 25,000 banks had failed and at the height of the 
Great Depression unemployment had risen to 25%. In the 21st Century we have already had a severe 
banking crisis. This crisis was again brought about by mismanagement and lack of oversight from 
regulating authorities which led to essentially banks betting that housing prices would continue to rise, 
leading to a “housing bubble”. Banks lent money to people who were not credit worthy, and they 
eventually could not pay back, which led to the banks losing money on the money they could not recover 
and “losing their bets” on the housing market. This Sub-Prime Mortgage Crisis, as it became known, 
affected banks all over the world causing severe banking failures in United Kingdom, Belgium, Iceland, 
Spain and Ireland to name a few.

Possible Threats in the Future
--------------------------------
Banks are subject to a lot of factors that influences the bank’s performance. This section explains what the most important threats to the current banking system are. 

**Current European problems**

The European debt crisis started end 2009 with the inability of some countries in Europe to finance their high debt-levels. This meant that large banks couldn’t be bailed out anymore in times of trouble, and that the amount of loans payed back to banks dropped. Although financial stability is restoring in these countries, it is still uncertain what happens to the financial system if an important bank has to be bailed out. The main message is that if banks fail in Europe, this will cause a shock of uncertainty about all banks in Europe.

**Deutsche Bank**

Deutsche Bank is the biggest bank of Germany and has a yearly revenue of approximately 47.4 billion US dollars and 1.7 trillion in assets. The bank came in trouble since July 2015 when the US government announced that the bank will be fined for her role in the sub-prime mortgage crisis in 2008. These fines put pressure on the financial wealth of the bank, therefore also the ability to pay for outstanding debt. Due to the high amount of fines, investors have pulled out money from Deutsche Bank, so that it lost more than half of its market value in one year. Since banks have interests in other banks, and they lend out money overnight to each other, this creates a certain interconnectedness. The figure below illustrates the interconnectedness of Deutsche Bank with other big banks around the world. Obviously, if Deutsche Bank falls, this will have a huge impact on the performance of many other banks which are both directly and indirectly linked. 

PLAATJE HIER

It’s not only Deutsche Bank that faces problems. Other European banks, mainly Italian, are struggling with outstanding loans that does not get paid back to the bank. This, too, puts financial pressure on the banks. Given the interconnectedness of banks and the problems of some EU governments, this is a big threat.

**Divided EU**

With Brexit happening, what happens with the banking sector if more countries would leave the European Union. Recently, some multi-nationals have rumored that they might leave London due to the unfavorable expected business climate in a non-EU Britain. This business environment is unfavorable since markets are less open and the cost of capital transportation is relatively higher. This raises the question what happens if more countries would leave the EU. Italy, for example, is having a referendum in December whether to reform the political structure in the country. The fear is that if the referendum ends up being a “no”, the current Prime Minister Renzi will resign. Since that the Five-star party in Italy is very popular at the moment, they will be likely to be elected in the new government. One of the main points in the party’s agenda is to leave Europe. This will create only more uncertainty about the future of Europe, and the attractiveness to be active in Europe as a financial institution. 

**Interest rate**

Another problem that European banks face nowadays is the low interest rate. Banks are less able to make profits since the investment return has lowered since the European Central Bank (ECB) has lowered the interest rate in 2012. The ECB has lowered the interest rate to increase inflation to the desired level of 2%. Since this it is not likely that this happens any time soon, European banks have to deal with these low rates, which is a tough challenge.

**Financial service development**

With the start of the consumer digitalization in the 1990s, the opportunities arose to optimize processes and communication has increased at an incredible rate. Nowadays, there are many financial technology companies (FinTechs) that substitute services of the banks. According to McKinsey, in the services that banks provide, 20%-60% of the profits and 10%-40% of the revenue will at risk by 2025 due to these FinTechs. For example, instead of expensive fund managers and investment funds, FinTech companies provide comparable services for a fraction of the costs that banks charge. These firms develop programs and use big data to invest consumer money in a similar way that banks would do. Another factor that is hugely affected by the digitalization is the provision of funds from-and-to consumers by companies. These parties no longer need the bank for funds, but can directly find a counterparty to exchange funds with. This process eliminates the need for banks, which is, obviously, a risk for banks. Social media enables fast information exchange, which might both negatively or positively affect bank reputation. Banks now have less time to react to problems due to the increase of communication speed. Obviously, banks still hold a strong position when it comes to expertise in the financial sector and information resources. Although we see that banks hold a strong position in the provision of liquidity and financial services in the economy, the competition in financial services increases rapidly. The future profit and revenue of banks might be at risk due to these FinTechs and digital innovations.

**Cyber criminality**

In line with the opportunities that the digitalization has to offer, this also has a downside. Computer criminals now have an extra dimension to rob money from institutions of individuals that have much funds. Banks encounter cyber criminality daily. In 2015, a group of hackers called ‘Businessclub’ stole approximately 100 million dollar from bank accounts by hacking the servers of banks. The cost of a cyber-attack is not only the money that is lost to hackers, but also retrieving information concerning the breach is costly, the impact on the bank’s brand reputation is costly since consumers lose faith due to social media, and there might be regulatory fines that lowers revenue and profit. Cyber security is getting more and more important.
